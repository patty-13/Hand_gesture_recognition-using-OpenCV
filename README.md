# Hand gestutre image Recognition

This project consist of feed forward neural network that is trained on Handgesture dataset taken from kaggle.com.
## How it works
1.The feed forward neuarl network is trained on dataset.<br>
2.The hands gestures are captured using webcam.<br>
3.The hand photo is then captured clicking the key (can be set by user).<br>
4.The captured image is then resized and send to the neural network for identification and then result is displayed on the screen<br>
